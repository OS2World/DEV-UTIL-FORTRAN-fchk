I have uploaded the OS/2 2.x recompile of Ftnchek, version 2.9.0.
Indeed, I can't call it a port since Robert Moniot (the author of
ftncheck) wrote it in a portable fashion, so that it just recompiles under
Eberhard Mattes' emx environment w/o any complaints. See the original
'readme' file.


The OS/2 2.x recompile can be found on the usual sites:

fchk290s.zip          --- sources
fchk290b.zip          --- binaries

ftp-os2.cdrom.com: (CD-ROM)

now:        /os2/incoming/
move to:    /os2/dev32/

ftp-os2.nmsu.edu:  (HOBBES)

now:        /incoming/
move to:    /os2/dev32/



A brief intro:
==============

ftnchek is a free Fortran syntax checker (some say, similar to
a commercial product called FLINT, which I don't know). It allows
to catch all kinds of problems Fortran is (in)famouse for: unassigned
variables, type casts, too long lines, wrong number / type of arguments
in calles to functions/subroutines etc. It can catch lots of problems
many Fortran compilers seem to fail finding.
To cut it short, it helps do what a normal Pascal compiler would do 
by itself on Pascal, for those of us who (still) need to use Fortran.
Read the docs to learn more.


The OS/2 port:
==============

It is now not a port anymore since OS/2 is a supported target in the
original distribution.  The original sources have been obtained
from ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu/pub/ on 25-Apr-96 as a *.tar.gz file.
I took the liberty to repackage them in a *.zip file for the people
without tar / gzip on their machines, or even for the last few people
not using the silly DOS 8.3 FAT file system under OS/2 instead of HPFS.



The second archive includes two binaries, 
'ftnchek.exe' and 'ftnchekS.exe'. 
'ftnchek.exe' needs the 'emx09b' runtime system to work  (can be found
as emxrt.zip on many ftp sites, including hobbes (ftp-os2.nmsu.edu)
and cdrom (ftp-os2.cdrom.com)). 'ftnchekS.exe' can be used w/o having 
emxrt installed.  I compiled them with gcc 2.7.2 / emx09b + emxfix03. 

All I did was: 
1) compiled it with gcc 2.7.2 / emx09b + emxfix03, using
     copy makefile.os2 makefile
     make OS2noemx
     make OS2emx
2) put the binaries, makefile, some docs in this archive
3) upload the whole thing due to request in two packages, the
   sources and the binaries with docs.

Read the files 'README', 'readme.os2', 'os2port.txt', and of course
the documention of 'ftnchek' for more information. ('os2port.txt' is
just included for historical reasons and documents the port done for
ftnchek 2.8.4.)

That's it. Have fun.            Stefan A. Deutscher ,  26-Apr-1996
