# This is just a dummy install-sh to make the autoconf macro
# AC_CANONICAL_HOST happy. It's supposed to be a substitute
# for systems that don't have an "install" command. I think.
#
# Since install isn't used, and there's an install procedure in 
# the Makefile, just leave this as a dummy file. But maybe later
# simplify the Makefile, and use the install-sh provided with 
# autoconf.
